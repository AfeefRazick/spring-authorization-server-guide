# Spring Authorization Server 0-90

This series is designed to take you 90% of the way with Spring Authorization Server,
covering essential concepts and implementations. The focus here is on mastering core
Spring Authorization Server principles.

My motivation to write this series is the immense amount of time I had to invest
in achieving certain aspects of this flow. Much of that time was spent due to some
misunderstanding of the bigger picture, as most online guides focused only on specific
subtopics and were not very useful beyond a tutorial level.
Because of this, you may find this article lengthy and overly in-depth, but I promise
to keep it as concise as possible.

Note: This is not a beginner’s guide. The content assumes familiarity with Spring
and related technologies to maintain focus on the Spring Authorization Server.
